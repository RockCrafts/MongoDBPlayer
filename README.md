# MongoDBPlayer

V1 of MongoDBPlayer for Minecraft by @RockCrafts#9703
-----------------------------------

Set your URI in the config file to connect to mongodb.
Then on startup, it will connect to DB. 

Once players join their information will be auto-saved in MongoDB every 5 minutes (default, can be changed in config.yml)

If you add the same uri to another server, when they join it will apply the following:

- Location
- Inventory
- Enderchest
---------------------

It will include the world, so make sure you name the worlds the same.

Uses of this:
if you have a network, if you want players to appear in the same place in multiple hubs, this can help

COMING SOON:

- Ability to disable certain saved things
- Gamemode
- Suggest more ideas!
